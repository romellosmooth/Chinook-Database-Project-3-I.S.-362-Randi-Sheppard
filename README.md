# Chinook-Database-Project-3-I.S.-362-Randi-Sheppard#
#This project demonstrates how to connect a MySQL relational database to a Jupyter Notebook using Python, 
extract multi-table data using SQL joins, and display the results in a pandas DataFrame. 
The Chinook database simulates a digital media store, and our goal is to show each customer's purchased tracks and album titles.#

#Objective:#
#Create a pandas DataFrame that displays:#

#Customer Last Name#

#Customer First Name#

#Purchased Track Name#

#Album Title Sorted alphabetically by customer name.#

#Tools Used#
#MySQL Workbench: To import and explore the Chinook database#

#Jupyter Notebook: For Python-based querying and data analysis#

#SQLAlchemy + pymysql: To connect Python to MySQL#

#pandas: To load and manipulate query results#

#Outcome#
#The final DataFrame successfully displays customer names alongside the tracks 
#and albums they purchased, sorted alphabetically.# 
#This project showcases relational joins, SQL querying, and Python data integration —#
#a great example of blending administrative insight with technical skills#
